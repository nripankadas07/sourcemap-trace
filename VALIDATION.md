# Validation on 5 October 2026

Status VALIDATED locally, awaiting public source and default-branch CI verification. Python 3.12.14 / Linux: 11 meaningful unit tests, module compilation, wheel build, clean virtual-environment wheel installation without an index, installed CLI help, structured missing-input exit 2, and standalone synthetic demo outside the source tree passed. Inputs/failure fixtures are in the committed tests. setuptools is a build-only dependency; no third-party runtime dependency. Portfolio resolver audit including setuptools reported zero known findings at observation.

The remote workflow targets Python 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14 and runs installation, the same unmodified tests, compilation, help and a demo outside the source directory. A repo is LIVE only after the intended public main matches reviewed source and these checks pass. No account-wide security certification, OS coverage, production adoption, timed benchmark or competitor superiority claim. See README for bounded subsets and concurrent filesystem limits.

Run `python -m unittest -v`, `python -m compileall -q sourcemap_trace.py`, `python -m pip install .`, `sourcemap-trace --help` and `python demo.py` to reproduce ordinary checks. For isolation copy demo.py to a separate directory and invoke the installed environment's Python there.
